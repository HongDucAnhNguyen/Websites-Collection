## Collection of websites I designed and built

### What is this?

- This collection of websites serves the purpose of showcasing my web design and front-end skills.

### My Design Philosophy

- Each website should be simple and effective, with an emphasis on great UX

- I believe while UI is important, I don't try hard to visually stand out with my websites, making it alienated. Most websites on the internet exist to try to market a product, service, etc... In short, to convey information efficiently, not to be a visual spectacle. You can create a good looking website and still follow web design rules that have proved to be essential over the years. It's about balance.

- All great websites are easy to navigate and serve key information right off the bat, they make visitors want to learn more about whatever is being featured, increasing conversion rates, or simply help users get things done in the most convenient ways possible. This is my standard when it comes to creating my websites.
